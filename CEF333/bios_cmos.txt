To reset your CMOS by reseating the CMOS Battery, follow the steps below:

  - Turn off your computer.
  -  Disconnect your computer from the wall outlet.
  -  Press the power button multiple times to clear any capacitors.
  -  Find the CMOS battery on your motherboard. This is most commonly a CR2032 battery, a coin-sized battery as shown below. Youâ€™ll find it near the PCI Express slots on most motherboards.
  -  Gently remove the CMOS battery. If it is secured by a metal clip, slide the battery out from under the clip. Take care not to bend the clip.
  -  Wait a few minutes, then replace the CMOS battery.
  -  Reboot your computer.
